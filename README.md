# Rainfall-Prediction-System
This project is totally based on Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistics Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree based on last 20 years of dataset which depends upon Min. Temperature, Max. temperature, humidity, moisture, Air and used to predict data of of 3 days, that day, and the next two upcoming days.
